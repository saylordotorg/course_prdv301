**Unit 4: The Judicial System** <span id="4"></span> 
*A system of justice requires a process for justice.  In general, that
process is available through the judicial system.  Lawyers and
paralegals must be familiar with various parts of the judicial system
and the appropriate way to access them.  For example, when your client
brings a case to you dealing with a breach of contract, which court will
you bring that to?  Is there any recourse if you lose the case?  When do
you know you have exhausted all of your client’s remedies?*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about a typical judicial system, using
the American system as a model.  Most judicial systems contain a basic
level of trial courts that address issues of fact and law.  If the
outcome is not satisfactory, a party and his or her legal team may
decide to appeal issues of law to an appeals court.  Many judicial
systems provide for intermediate courts of appeal and one ultimate
decider.  For example, you will see that in the United States, decisions
of Courts of Appeal may be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United
States.  Any legal issues decided by the Supreme Court are final and may
not be appealed further.  As a paralegal, you must understand how this
process works to adequately serve your employers and clients.*
