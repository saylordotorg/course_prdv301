**Unit 5: The Legal Process** <span id="5"></span> 
*While you have become familiar with the components of the judicial
system, this is obviously not enough for you to be an effective
paralegal.  For example, you may know which court to bring a client’s
complaint to regarding a claim against the client’s doctor, but what
happens when you get there?  What forms and documents have to be filed? 
How do you address motions to the judge?*  
  
 *In this unit, you will explore how the process works in dealing with
courts and judges.  Certain fundamental filings are required to bring a
civil action in court.  Different filings are required for a criminal
action.  In addition, you will be introduced to the filing of motions to
the court.  Lastly, it is important to understand that many legal
processes provide for less formal ways of resolving disputes.  This unit
will also introduce you to methods of alternative dispute resolution, or
ADR.*

     Instructions: Now that you have become familiar with the legal
    system, it is time to learn how a case makes its way through that
    system.  On the civil side, a trial is the culmination of a
    sometimes lengthy process of litigation.  Please click on the link
    above and read Chapter 11, which begins on page 101.  In this
    reading, you will learn about the importance of jurisdiction and
    venue to the litigation process.  In addition, you will learn how
    litigation is initiated, and you will familiarize yourself with the
    process by which a party may obtain information in the hands of
    another party – the discovery process.  Lastly, you will become
    familiar with the various ways in which courts may dispose of a
    case.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this brief
    lecture.  As its name implies, alternative dispute resolution, or
    ADR, provides an alternative method for resolving legal disputes.
     Litigation is generally expensive and time-consuming, and it may be
    damaging to important relationships.  ADR offers various methods to
    avoid some of these pitfalls, such as negotiation, mediation, and
    arbitration.  These three primary methods of ADR are discussed in
    this lecture.  Be aware, however, that ADR has its own set of
    drawbacks that lawyers must consider in deciding the best approach
    to resolving a legal dispute.  
      
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes will take
    approximately 15 minutes.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: The process by which a criminal case makes its way
    through the legal system is generally similar to civil litigation
    but with some very important distinctions.  Please click on the link
    above and read Chapter 13, which begins on page 132.  In this
    reading, you will learn about two important aspects of criminal law:
    substantive and procedural law.  Substantive criminal law addresses
    what activities are considered criminal, while procedural law deals
    with the rules lawyers and others must follow in participating in a
    criminal case.  As with civil litigation, you will find that
    jurisdiction plays an important role.  You should also come to
    understand the basis for the laws underlying the criminal
    prosecution.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
     Docket control, also known as calendaring, is an important part of
    the paralegal’s responsibilities in a law office.  The paralegal is
    often relied on to ensure that important deadlines are recorded and
    tracked to ensure timely filings and appearances.  You will note
    that most modern law offices use some form of electronic
    calendaring.  Keep in mind the great importance of this task –
    deadlines, for example, can make the difference between a client
    recovering damages or being denied.  To perform this important duty,
    paralegals must not only be organized, but also must be familiar
    with various rules governing the litigation process.

     Like just about all other aspects of professional life, technology
    has changed the way law offices interact with the legal process.
     Most courts in the United States, including the federal courts, now
    provide for e-filing of documents required for civil or criminal
    actions.  So, for example, pleadings can be uploaded directly to a
    court database.  This article gives you an overview of the process
    and its importance.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
     Discovery is the process by which the parties to a legal case
    exchange information so that everyone is dealing with the same
    facts.  Paralegals should be familiar with the court rules that
    govern the discovery process.  This process involves requests to the
    other party or parties to provide documents.  It can also take the
    form of written questions, known as interrogatories, as well as
    depositions and requests for expert witness opinions.  Note the
    important role the paralegal plays in the discovery process.

     Subpoenas play a vital role in the discovery process.  A subpoena
    is a court-authorized document compelling a witness to provide
    testimony or documents in a case.  Failure to abide by a valid
    subpoena in the absence of any legally recognized exceptions can
    result in penalties.  This reading gives an overview of the process,
    focusing on practice in federal courts in the United States.  Though
    presented from the point-of-view of an associate attorney,
    paralegals often play an important role in the subpoena process.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this article.
    This article presents a good overview of the process of managing
    client files and records.  This is a key function of the paralegal.
     With the massive amount of information that can be collected in a
    civil case, it is vitally important that the information be stored
    in an organized and easy-to-access manner.  Note that computerized
    records management has become the norm in law offices, and
    paralegals are required to be familiar with such systems.  Two of
    the most common database tools are Summation and Concordance.
