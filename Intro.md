Course Syllabus for "PRDV301: Introduction to Paralegal Studies"
----------------------------------------------------------------

With the expansion of law and the legal process into so many areas of
everyday life, the responsibilities of the legal profession have
expanded to meet new challenges.  For example, the advent of the
Internet since the early 1990s has raised a multitude of new legal
issues related to various areas of intellectual property, including
copyright, patent law, and trademark law.  In recognition of the fact
that many law-related responsibilities can be handled by well-educated
and trained non-lawyers, the legal profession has increasingly come to
depend on the assistance of paralegals.  Paralegals perform key
functions within a law office from drafting legal documents to
investigating cases and interviewing witnesses.  While they are no
replacement for lawyers, paralegals have become recognized as key
components of a well-functioning legal office. This course will
introduce you to the basic knowledge and skills required of paralegals. 
You will familiarize yourself with basics of the American legal system,
as well as the substantive areas of law that are addressed within this
system.  You will also learn and apply skills, such as researching legal
issues, interviewing clients and witnesses, and drafting motions and
pleadings.  By the end of this course, you will have a clear
understanding of what a paralegal does, the skills needed to be a
successful paralegal, and what it will take to begin a career as a
paralegal.
