**Unit 6: Substantive Areas of Law: An Overview** <span id="6"></span> 
*An entrepreneur comes to your law office.  She is interested in
starting a business and is seeking your advice.  She asks, “What form of
business should I choose?  How can my partners and I protect ourselves
in case we are sued?  What might we be sued for?  Can you help us draft
contracts with suppliers and key employees?”*  
  
 *These basic questions raise issues touching on various substantive
areas of law.  In this unit, you will learn about the leading areas of
substantive law that lawyers and paralegals are exposed to.  For
example, if your entrepreneur client is sued because her product injures
someone, you will need to be familiar with tort law.  If the client and
her business partners agree to part ways after the business has been
operating for a while, you will want to be familiar with contract and
property law to determine who is entitled to what.  While many
paralegals work for large law firms and specialize in a substantive area
of law, the majority of paralegals will need to be familiar with several
substantive areas of law.  This unit will give you a good introduction
to the major substantive areas.*
