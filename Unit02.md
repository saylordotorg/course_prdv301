**Unit 2: The Legal System** <span id="2"></span> 
*Each legal system is different.  Its foundations may present widely
different ways of approaching the law and understanding the distribution
of power.  The United States, due to unique historical circumstances,
has developed a system of law very different from China, France, and
even the United Kingdom.*  
  
 *This unit will introduce you to the foundations of law in the United
States.  The unique system of separation of powers together with
federalism have shaped the process of law in the United States.  The
president, the Congress, and the court system each have separate powers
that the other branches cannot interfere with.  For example, judges are
given lifetime appointments and cannot be removed by the president or
Congress without an impeachment trial.  In addition, the separate powers
of the federal and state governments also shape the legal process.  You
will learn this and more as the unit closes with a comparison of the
American system with other systems.*

    For this sub-subunit, focus on the discussion of the separation of

    this concept was revolutionary in ensuring that the three branches

    and balance each other’s powers.  Today, an independent judiciary is
    considered critical to a true system of justice.
