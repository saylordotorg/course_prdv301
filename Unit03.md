**Unit 3: Sources of the Law** <span id="3"></span> 
*We think we know what we are talking about when we talk about the law. 
But what exactly is the law, and where does it come from?  For example,
the United States Supreme Court decided in 1954 that there could not be
separate schools for blacks and whites in America.  Is this law?  What
other sources of law are there?*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about where the law comes from.  A
paralegal can have all the research skills in the world, but it will not
matter much if the paralegal does not know what valid law is and what is
merely commentary or opinion.  You will learn how to locate and
interpret relevant court cases to assist you and the lawyers you work
for in making strong legal arguments.  You will also learn how to locate
statutory law – law passed by legislative bodies– and the unique
challenges related to interpreting statutes.*

     Instructions: Now that you have familiarized yourself with the
    various definitions of “law,” you need to understand where the law
    comes from.  In democratic societies, the ultimate source of the law
    is usually founded on a constitution with lawmaking authority in a
    legislature.  In fact, there are various other sources of law in
    democratic societies.  For example, consider the role of customs and
    of government agencies.  Please click on the link above and read
    Chapter 2, which begins on page 10.  This reading will familiarize
    you with these various sources of law.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read Chapter 3,
    which begins on page 19.  There are various types of law.  For
    example, some law addresses the substance of a claim (e.g. did the
    defendant act negligently), while other law addresses the procedure
    to be used in addressing claims (e.g. what information must be
    presented when a plaintiff files a claim).  In addition, some law
    affects the relationship of the government to citizens, while other
    law bears the relationships between private parties.  This reading
    will introduce you to these and other classifications of the law.  
      
     Reading this chapter should take approximately 15 minutes.

    each state in the federal system of the United States has its own
    constitution.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: On the linked webpage, scroll down to “Teaching
    Resources,” and click on “How to Read a Case” to download the PDF. 
    While the article was written for a particular course, its advice
    for reading cases is generally applicable.  The article provides a
    strong introduction to reading and analyzing cases for non-lawyers. 
    Note particularly the doctrine of *stare decisis* and how this
    impacts the evolution of case law in the United States.  You will
    also need to become an expert at distinguishing issues of fact and
    issues of law.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

    [“How to Brief a
    Case”](http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/research/brief.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Interpreting a case law begins with understanding
    what happened in a case.  To do this, students of the law and
    paralegals use a somewhat standard form for “briefing a case.”
     Briefing cases involves setting out the key information in a case
    in a logical and easy-to-use format.  As the article points out, be
    careful to avoid confusing this kind of briefing, which is a tool
    for understanding, with an appellate brief, in which attorneys lay
    out the legal arguments for overturning a lower adjudicator’s
    decision.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 20 minutes.
