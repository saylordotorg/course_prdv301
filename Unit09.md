**Unit 9: The Regulation and Ethical Duties of Paralegals** <span
id="9"></span> 
*Clients come to law offices relying on lawyers and paralegals to be
trustworthy and to exercise their best efforts on behalf of the client. 
In the example in the introduction to Unit 7, we spoke of an
entrepreneur in business.  What if that client’s husband calls seeking
information on the case?  You might presume that their interests are the
same, but what if they are not?  Should you provide information to the
client’s husband?*  
  
 *This unit will address the law regulating paralegals and the ethical
duties involved in this profession.  While the laws directly regulating
paralegals are not generally as fully developed as those regulating
lawyers, it is important to remember that lawyers generally employ
paralegals.  Attorneys you will be working for are governed by both
Model Rule developed by the American Bar Association as well as
state-specific codes of Professional Responsibility.  Each has rules
relating to paralegals and legal administrative staff.* *As a result,
the legal and ethical duties of lawyers are impacted by the actions of
their paralegals.  Like a lawyer, a paralegal is going to be expected to
maintain confidentiality, avoid conflicts with the interests of the
client, and know the limits of the paralegal’s representation of the
client.  This unit will provide a firm foundation for understanding the
paralegal’s duties.*

    country’s largest association of attorneys with regard to effective
    use of paralegal services.  As you read, keep in mind that the
    provision of basic legal services by paralegals independent of the
    supervision of attorneys provides a challenge to the virtual
    monopoly licensed lawyers have on the provision of legal services. 
    Note the emphasis on the central responsibility of the attorney for
    the actions of paralegals.
