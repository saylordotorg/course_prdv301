**Unit 1: What Is a Paralegal?** <span id="1"></span> 
*So what does a paralegal do, anyway?  You may have heard the term
before.  You probably know they work with lawyers.  You may even know
someone who works as a paralegal, whose descriptions of the work he or
she does make it sound pretty interesting.*  
  
 *This unit will introduce you to the work that paralegals do.  You may
be surprised to find that paralegals do a wide range of work that
lawyers depend on to put legal cases together and to successfully
operate a law office.  For example, a lawyer may rely on a paralegal to
research court cases that help the lawyer understand a particular case. 
Paralegals often play a key role in putting together key legal
documents, such as motions to a judge.  This unit will help you
understand how paralegals participate in constructing a legal case as
well as the relationship of the paralegal to other staff who work in a
law office.*

**1.1 Definition of the Term “Paralegal”** <span id="1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: American Bar Association’s “Current ABA Definition of
    Legal Assistant/Paralegal”**
    Link: American Bar Association’s [“Current ABA Definition of Legal
    Assistant/Paralegal”](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/paralegals/resources/current_aba_definition_of_legal_assistant_paralegal.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and review the
    American Bar Association’s broad definition of legal
    assistant/paralegal.  Note that the definition does not distinguish
    between a legal assistant and a paralegal.  While the term paralegal
    is becoming the dominant term for paraprofessionals who assist
    lawyers with substantive legal work, the terms are often used
    interchangeably.  As you review this definition, ask yourself the
    following questions: what qualifications this definition requires? 
    What is meant by “substantive legal work?”

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: While this material is geared toward explaining the
    benefits of paralegals to lawyers, it offers considerable insight
    into the nature of the relationship between the paralegal and
    lawyers.  Note that paralegals may do just about anything a lawyer
    can do, so long as they are supervised by a lawyer.  Thus, the
    foundation of the relationship of lawyer to paralegal is
    supervisory.  However, the relationship goes beyond this, as skilled
    paralegals can increase the profitability and flexibility of a law
    office.  As you review the ethical responsibilities of attorneys
    regarding the use of paralegals, ask yourself the following
    question: how does this impact the ethical responsibilities of the
    paralegal?  
      
     Reading this material and answering the question above should take
