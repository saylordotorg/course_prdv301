**Unit 7: Legal Research and Legal Citation** <span id="7"></span> 
*Knowledge of what the law currently says about particular legal issues
is the foundation of any legal work.  Many people seem to assume that
lawyers know the answers to all legal questions and have those answers
readily at hand when presented with a particular scenario.  However, it
is more usual that a lawyer will need to familiarize him or herself with
at least some issues of law with which the lawyer is not fully
familiar.*  
  
 *Much of the work of researching the law has fallen to paralegals.  For
example, a particular legal scenario– or fact pattern– may involve the
legal standards applicable when a child is injured by falling into a
swimming pool on a neighbor’s property.  You will review court cases,
which will most likely present very similar facts or legal issues.  In
addition, you will need to check state and possibly federal statutes to
see whether any statutory law applies.  There are also a range of
resources that can assist a paralegal in finding related cases and
statutes.  In this unit, you will learn about how to access this
important information.*

     Instructions: This resource presents a list with links of law
    libraries in the United States that provide public access.  These
    public access law libraries are an important source of information
    to the public and to legal professionals for primary and secondary
    authority on the law.  You are invited to click on various links to
    get a flavor of what is on offer at the publicly accessible law
    libraries.  If you do not live in the United States or if your state
    is not represented here, you should explore your country or state’s
    government websites for information regarding publicly accessible
    law collections.  Lastly, be sure to click on the link to the
    “Internet Public Library” to view online legal resources
    available.

**7.1.2 What You Will Find in a Law Library** <span id="7.1.2"></span>

    Law Library”**

    Library”](http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED250261&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=ED250261)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: To access this reading from the ERIC website, click
    on the link to “ERIC Full Text.”  This is a 1977 document, but it
    still remains applicable to the volumes found in law libraries
    today.  This document is particularly valuable, because it lays out
    a systematic, four-method approach to using the resources found in a
    law library.  Note the value of beginning with legal encyclopedias
    to familiarize yourself with a topic and related law.  Also, note
    that hard copy legal materials often contain “pocket parts” attached
    to the back cover or supplements to update the ever-changing law.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

    Sasala, Esq.’s “Westlaw Digest System and LEXIS Headnote System”**

    System”](http://www.clelaw.lib.oh.us/public/misc/Westlaw%20Lexis.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this
    introduction to the Westlaw Digest System and LEXIS Headnote
    System.  Westlaw and Lexis are the leading proprietary
    computer-based legal research systems in the United States.  Most
    every law office, law school, law library, and government agency
    pays considerable amounts for access to these resources.  Billing
    for use of Westlaw and LEXIS can be time-based or search-based, but
    either way, a good paralegal will know that fees can add up very
    quickly and any employer will appreciate efficient, cost-sensitive
    research.  As a paralegal student, you should familiarize yourself
    with both of these resources, as you are very likely to use them in
    your professional career.  A publicly accessible law library may
    provide access to Westlaw and LEXIS.  Like hard copy volumes, there
    are various approaches to using these resources, including key
    number searches, topic searches, and case-based searches.  
      
     Reading this material take approximately 30 minutes.

    Citation”](http://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/full_toc.htm)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This material provides a brief introduction to the
    purposes of legal citation.  Legal citation follows a select few
    standard formats that may seem a bit confusing to the uninitiated.
     There is, however, a strict logic that applies to these formats.
     Note in particular from this reading the three main functions of
    legal citation, and keep these in mind as you approach the
    subject.  
      
     Reading this introduction should take approximately 10 minutes.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This reading provides a brief introduction to the
    topic of cite-checking.  A key role for a paralegal is insuring that
    the citations, or “cites,” used in legal writing are accurate and
    conform to the standard used by the attorneys for which the
    paralegal works.  This reading addresses what cite-checking is and
    why it is important, as well as provides a useful list of tips for
    the paralegal to keep in mind when cite-checking.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 10 minutes.

**7.3.2 Citation Standards** <span id="7.3.2"></span>

    Sets Citation Norms”](http://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/1-600.htm)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: As you consider the subject of citation, you may
    wonder who gets to set the standards for citation.  Is it the
    courts?  Some other agency of government?  As this article notes,
    for years the standard was *The Bluebook* produced by a consortium
    of four law school journal editorial boards.  In fact, it still
    maintains a position as the leading citation authority.  However,
    others do exist and, in fact, court rules also have an impact on
    legal citation.  Nonetheless, it is very likely that any law firm
    with which you gain employment is likely to have a copy of *The
    Bluebook* in its library.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 10 minutes.
